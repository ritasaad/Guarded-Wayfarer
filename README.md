# Guarded-Wayfarer
The purpose of this project is to raise awareness on road safety issues among pedestrians, commuters and drivers.
Our project consists of the following:
1-A Pibrella connected to our Raspberry Pi to set off the alarm
2-A sensor that operates as motion detector to sense every moving vehicle. We also used five LEDs: three for the cars for the purpose of the traffic lights and two for pedestrians. 
So how does it work? 
 “Guarded Wayfarer” focuses on two major focal points: the sensor and the alarm.
As soon as the traffic light is red, the pedestrians’ light automatically turns green.In the meantime, the sensor immediately operates. the alarm goes on if the distance between a car and the pedestrian crossing is less than 50 cm Meanwhile, in case a car runs the red light by almost 50 centimeters further, the alarm goes off.
